### Graduate Student Researcher @ Westminster City Council (_November 2023 - July 2024_)

- Enabled targeted air quality interventions by identifying critical hotspots and temporal fluctuations around 96 schools and analyzing emissions from 116 commercial kitchens in Soho, using advanced statistical methods and GIS.
- Supported decision-makers with actionable insights through a Power BI dashboard that tracked key KPIs, including pollutant levels, spatiotemporal trends, and WHO AQG compliance around key areas.
- Advanced pollution trend analysis by developing three spatial-econometric models, revealing the significant influence of three key geographic factors on pollution levels, which contributed to more effective policy intervention by the council.
- Developed and deployed advanced time series models like ARIMAX and deep learning models (LSTM, GRU-ODE, GRU-Bayes) to accurately predict pollution levels for six key pollutants in Westminster, achieving a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy.

## My Projects

### An Analysis of Airbnb Prices in New York City

[Project1](Project1/Airbnb.html)

This project analyzed factors influencing Airbnb prices in New York City using statistical analysis methods and data visualization. It included property segmentation based on characteristics like location and amenities, and audience analysis to assess market demand and pricing trends across neighborhoods. The insights aid stakeholders in developing data-driven pricing strategies for selecting the best places.  

### Comparing Machine Learning Methods for Predicting Income Increase

[Project Report PDF][Project2/ML Report.pdf]

This project investigated median income increases across New York counties from 2014 to 2019. We used socio-demographic data on the US census tract level to predict whether a given census tract experienced positive economic growth, measured by the median income. We collected data from the US Census Bureau for the economic and social indicators on the Census Tract Level made available from the American Community Survey 5-Year Data (ACS5). To measure the economic change, we retrieved the median income for both 2014 and 2019 and computed the percentage change over the time period. In addition, we created a new variable to classify a census tract based on the direction of change in median income. Using socio-economic factors like education and unemployment rate, among many others, as predictors, we utilized Machine Learning models from linear regression to Neural Networks to identify significant predictors of income growth and to provide insights into factors driving economic development in different regions.

### Predicting Yelp Review Popularity 

[Project3](https://github.com/StephenCode24/myportfolio.github.io/tree/main/Project3)

The insights generated from this project were tailored to enhance Yelpâ€™s review management system to support a more engaging customer experience. The project aimed to predict which reviews are most likely to be useful and popular. Leveraging Big Data frameworks and natural language processing techniques, it analyzed key factors influencing review utility, enabling the development of machine learning models that accurately forecast review popularity.  

### Developing Methods for the Coordinate Descent Algorithm

[Project4](https://github.com/StephenCode24/myportfolio.github.io/tree/main/Project4)

This project involved developing coordinate descent algorithms to solve lasso and elastic net regression problems, with a focus on optimizing predictive accuracy and variable selection. K-fold cross-validation was applied to fine-tune models using mean-squared error (MSE) values for optimization. Performance was analyzed across scenarios where the number of data points (n) exceeds the number of variables (p), and where variables (p) exceed data points (n). The results demonstrated that elastic net outperforms lasso, particularly in complex scenarios with highly correlated variables and limited data availability.
