### Graduate Student Researcher @ Westminster City Council (_November 2023 - July 2024_)

- Enabled targeted air quality interventions by identifying critical hotspots and temporal fluctuations around 96 schools and analyzing emissions from 116 commercial kitchens in Soho, using advanced statistical methods and GIS.
- Supported decision-makers with actionable insights through a Power BI dashboard that tracked key KPIs, including pollutant levels, spatiotemporal trends, and WHO AQG compliance around key areas.
- Advanced pollution trend analysis by developing three spatial-econometric models, revealing the significant influence of three key geographic factors on pollution levels, which contributed to more effective policy intervention by the council.
- Developed and deployed advanced time series models like ARIMAX and deep learning models (LSTM, GRU-ODE, GRU-Bayes) to accurately predict pollution levels for six key pollutants in Westminster, achieving a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy.
