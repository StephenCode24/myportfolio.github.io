### Project1: An Analysis of Airbnb Prices in New York City:                                                                                                                                 October- November 2023
This project analysed factors influencing Airbnb prices in New York City using statistical analysis methods and data visualization. It included property segmentation based on characteristics like location and amenities, and audience analysis to assess market demand and pricing trends across neighbourhoods. The insights aid stakeholders develop data-driven pricing strategies for selecting best places.
