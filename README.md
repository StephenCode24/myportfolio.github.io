## Related Experiences
#### Graduate Student Researcher @ Westminster City Council (_November 2023- July 2024_)
-	Enabled targeted air quality interventions by identifying critical hotspots and temporal fluctuations around 96 schools and analysing emissions from 116 commercial kitchens in Soho, using advanced statistical methods and GIS.
-	Supported decision-makers with actionable insights through a Power BI dashboard that tracked key KPIs, including pollutant levels, spatiotemporal trends, and WHO AQG compliance around key areas. 
-	Advanced pollution trend analysis by developing three spatial-econometric models, revealing the significant influence of 3 most geographic factors on pollution levels, which contributed to more effective policy intervention by the council. 
-	Developed and deployed advanced time series models like ARIMAX and deep learning models (LSTM, GRU-ODE, GRU-Bayes) to accurately predict pollution levels for 6 key pollutants in Westminster, achieving a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy.

## My Project
#### An Analysis of Airbnb Prices in New York City (_October- November 2023_)
This project analysed factors influencing Airbnb prices in New York City using statistical analysis methods and data visualization. It included property segmentation based on characteristics like location and amenities, and audience analysis to assess market demand and pricing trends across neighbourhoods. The insights aid stakeholders develop data-driven pricing strategies for selecting best places.

#### Project3: Predicting Yelp Review Popularity (_March- April 2024_)
The insights generated from this project were tailored to enhance Yelpâ€™s review management system to support a more engaging customer experience. The project sought to do this by predicting which reviews are most likely to be useful and popular. Leveraging Big Data frameworks and natural language processing techniques, it analysed key factors influencing review utility, enabling the development of machine learning models that accurately forecast review popularity.
